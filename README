=== Instructions ===

1. Clone this repository to some place on a server.  Make sure you got a
   version with the image data (mine is at
   https://bitbucket.org/JasonGross/alphabets-with-data)

2. Make sure the files and .htaccess are readable by the world.  (On afs, this
   is
     fsr sa . system:anyuser read

   You might want to replace system:anyuser with www, if that's appropriate to
   your server.)

3. Make sure that working-directory/, results/, and object-storage/ are
   writable by your server daemon (for MIT scripts, this is daemon.scripts; for
   csail, this is www.  The command on afs, for MIT scripts, is:

     fsr sa working-directory/ daemon.scripts write
     fsr sa results/ daemon.scripts write
     fsr sa object-storage/ daemon.scripts write

  You should replace daemon.scripts with the name of the user profile on the
  webserver that runs the scripts.)

3. Make sure the server can run python.

  3a. If the python files are downloaded rather than run, try commenting out
      the line at the top of the .htaccess file which tells the server to treat
      .py files as cgi scripts.

4. Replace instances of //jgross.scripts.mit.edu/alphabets/ with the path to
   this folder over the internet.  Note that the leading '//' says "if you
   access me over https, use https://; if you access me over http, use
   http://".  Alternatively, fix everything to use the appropriate relative
   paths, figure out how to get python to automatically figure out it's
   web-address (the line in alphabetspaths.py), and then email me at jgross AT
   mit DOT edu with a patch.
