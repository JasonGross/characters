  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
  Learning is an active area of research, both from the psychological
  perspective of discovering how people learn, and from the artificial
  intelligence perspective of trying to program computers to mimic human
  learning abilities.  While learning is often thought of as gathering
  knowledge, much learning also takes place on a more abstract level, for
  example in the forming generalizations about things we encounter, in
  categorizing objects, or in learning the structure of the knowledge we
  acquire.  Although it is not hard to make computers adept at gathering
  information (e.g. google), it is much harder to program computers to learn how
  to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
  Josh Tenenbaum, the mentor of my UROP, is currently investigating categorical
  learning, where the inputs are various objects and the output is a
  categorization of those objects. The simplest form of learning to learn, in
  this context, is a first order generalization about categories.  For example,
  if a learner is categorizing animals, the learner might find that humans have
  two legs and no tail, tigers have four legs and a tail, and spiders have eight
  legs and no tail.  If the learner is categorizing letters, the learner might
  discover that most Latin letters are the same thickness, without small
  details, and mostly connected (i.e. each letter is a single piece), and most
  Chinese letters are similar in thickness, have many details, and are made of
  multiple pieces. There are also second order generalizations about categories.
  Within any species of animal, the number of legs and the presence of a tail
  are generally constant, while the size and surface patterns may vary widely.
  In the case of letters, a learner may realize that the level of detail and the
  connectedness of characters is generally constant within an alphabet, but
  varies between alphabets. Learners who make second order generalizations can
  make reasonable hypotheses about new categories on the basis of a very small
  number of samples; seeing only a single character from a new alphabet, say
  formed without much detail in a single piece, a learner who thinks that
  connectedness and level of detail are similar within a category can reasonably
  infer that this alphabet has letters consisting of a single connected piece
  without small details.
  </p>
  <p>
  The UROP I am doing involves collecting and analyzing many handwriting samples
  of various characters from various alphabets that the writer may or may not
  have seen before.  The handwriting samples will be used as input data to help
  design an algorithm that can transfer inferences about a single category
  (alphabet) to new categories, via a model of second order generalizations.
  Because the samples will be collected digitally, via Amazon Mechanical Turk, I
  will be working on campus.
  </p>
  <h2>Personal Role &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
  I've collected twenty handwriting samples of each character in fifty different
  alphabets have been collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  Examples can be
  found at <a
    href="http://web.mit.edu/brenden/www/charactervideos.html">http://web.mit.edu/brenden/www/charactervideos.html</a>.
  Russ and Brenden (grad students involved in the UROP) have programmed various
  algorithms (both general and specific, pixel-based and stroke-based) to
  attempt various character recognition and categorization tasks.  A description
  of the performance of Brenden's model can (currently) be found at
  <a
    href="http://web.mit.edu/jgross/Public/lake_etal_cogsci2011.pdf">lake_etal_cogsci2011.pdf</a>. 
  I've begun to collect data for a human baseline performance on similar tasks.
  So far, I've designed and run, on a small scale, an experiment in which
  subjects are presented with an example character for a brief period of time
  (on the order of 50 ms), which is then covered with noise, and then presented
  with an example image.  The subject must say whether the two images are
  examples of the same character, or different characters.  As this is the first
  time (as far as I understand what my mentors have told me) that a data set
  like this has been collected, we're not sure what the best experiments are to
  find a human baseline.  Presently, I'm in the process of designing a webpage
  (experiment data collection setup) for collecting data on how long it takes
  subjects to distinguish between various different characters.  Other types of
  data to be collected might include data about how well people do at
  categorizing characters into alphabets, or data that is more similar to the
  tasks that the models are tested on, such as, given an example of a character
  that they've never seen before, picking out which of twenty images (also never
  seen before), are drawings of the same character as the example.  Part of the
  process will be to discuss and evaluate various ways of asking the question
  "how good are people at learning characters that they've never seen before?",
  though I anticipate not being able to contribute much to this decision
  process.  (I do, however, find such discussions between Josh and Russ and
  Brenden interesting.)
  </p>
  <p>
  I might help my mentors with the models they'll be running on the data, and I
  hope to contribute to the paper my mentors are working on.

  <h2>Goals/Personal Statement</h2>
  <p>
  I find the concept of learning interesting, from the perspective of trying to
  understand how the mind works and from the perspective of artificial
  intelligence. I hope to learn more about learning from this UROP. I hope to
  learn what kind of questions there are to be asked about learning, and
  possibly be involved in discovering answerers to some of these (for example,
  there is the question of whether, when asked to draw a new instance of a
  character they've never seen before, people start with a general concept of
  what a character is, and then refine it to better match the given example, or
  if they first start with drawings that are close to the given image, and then
  impose the constraint that it must be "character-like", or something else
  entirely).  Additionally, I enjoy programming, and hope to improve my skills
  through working on the data collection aspect of this UROP. Ultimately, I hope
  to enjoy my UROP experience, and better learn what type of research, and which
  processes involved in research, I enjoy.
